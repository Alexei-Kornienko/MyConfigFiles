*) Nested pojects is now supported. If one project is a subdir(s) of another
   one, then only nested poject will be used for inner files.  This will also
   wok for PROJECTS_PARENT. I mean, you can set up your .indexer_files just like
   that:

[PROJECTS_PARENT]
~/dev
~/dev/SomePoject

and then each di in ~/dev will be a separat project, and each dir in ~/dev/SomeProject will also be sepate project.

*) Some bugfix.
